# DC Coming soon

## Requirements

1. JRuby
2. [Poppler](http://poppler.freedesktop.org/)

## Huh? Why are you using JRuby?

Because [Tabular Extractor](https://github.com/tabulapdf/tabula-extractor) requires it.

## Huh? Why are you using [pdftotext](https://github.com/benbalter/pdftotext) and not something like [PDF Reader](https://github.com/yob/pdf-reader)?

PDF Reader doesn't properly handle superscript text, which ABRA often uses in street names (the text bleeds into the line above it).
